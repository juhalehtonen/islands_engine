# IslandsEngine

An Elixir/OTP game engine for Islands, a battleship-esque multiplayer game. All code is based on the book [Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/lhelph/functional-web-development-with-elixir-otp-and-phoenix) by Lance Halvorsen.

The Phoenix-based web UI for the game resides in a different, private repository, so this repo doesn't come with a playable setup. See the book for details on how to manage the UI with Phoenix.
